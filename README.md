# Unity XR Avatar
The Unity XR Avatar package provides a set of assets to help with user representation in XR when developing in [Unity]. This can be just hand and controller representation or even full body avatar. For the time being this pakcage only offers hand and controller representation.

It includes models of the different controllers that come with the most popular HMDs as well as the Oculus hands that are [freely available][OculusHandModels].

This package was made by combining and extending the resources found in the following tutorials:
- [Introduction to VR in Unity - PART 2 : INPUT and HAND PRESENCE][ValemTutorial]
- [Custom Hands for Unity's XR Toolkit [01]][VRWithAndrewTutorial]

> **Requires** the Unity software version `2019.3` (or above).
